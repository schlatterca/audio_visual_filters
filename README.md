# audio_visual_filters

“Audio_Visual_Filters” is a project by Jan Angelini, Alessandro Bettini and Carlo Andrea Schlatter, completed as the final project for the Elements of Informatics course held by prof. Davide Riboli at ISIA Urbino in the 2019-20 Academic year. It consists of a sketch, written in P5.js language through the OpenProcessing web editor, together with a website, written on Sublime Text and uploaded as a GitHub Pages through a specific repository. The sketch employs microphone and webcam of the device in use to allow users to see their shapes, colors and gestures changed according to the surrounding sounds and noises: the four different filters refer to four “ghosts” inspired by the sound and visual panoramas of the Nine Inch Nails music, to which the site’s gallery is dedicated. In fact, “Audio_Visual_Filters” includes a section through which the user can browse the effects of multiple filters applied to NIN music videos, and explore the influence of their songs on related videos. Derived from the open source mindset, the project is an invitation for the users to explore the different possibilities given by an artistic approach to audio/video tools and creative coding, both towards the videos that surround them, and towards the image captured by their webcam.
